# Pokemore

## Description
Pokemore is a collection of experiments and implementations for building language models that generate new names — inspired by Pokémonnames, or custom datasets.

This project explores various techniques to train character-level models using PyTorch, and is heavily inspired by Andrej Karpathy’s “Zero to Hero” series and his makemore project.

## Goals
- Understand and implement n-gram models
- Build neural network-based character-level language models
- Compare model performance across different architectures
- Generate novel and fun name-like strings

## Inspiration
This repo follows the learning path from:
- [Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpzmRsG7u_gk1xwwD7WV1z6aab0RLWfW5) by Andrej Karpathy
- The original [makemore](https://github.com/karpathy/makemore) project

## Structure
- data/ - input text files
- notebooks/ - Jupyter explorations
